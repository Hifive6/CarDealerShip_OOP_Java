Goals for today:
review and cement the basic OOP principles
become a little more comfortable with "big" applications
our thought process when we nee dto start designing an applications


Car dealership
   - which to design first? the publice interface or the inner details
        -top down or bottom up design concept
        depends on a lot fo factore and most -teams will use both when delievering software

    - Top Down: identify top level objects first then find teh objects that represent smaller portions of the system.
        - We continually refine those definistion untill the system is complete 
        - In our dealership application whti ma look like thisdesinging objects in the order
            -dealership
            -department
            -staff
            -vehicles
    - Bottom up: the lowest level of objects would be designed first an dthen those obejcest would be combined into bigger moduels untiel the overal system is complete.
        - in the dealership this would be designed in this order:
            -vehicles
            -department
            -dealership
            -staff

Starting with vehicles
    - object hierarachy
        - Gen-Spec (Generalized-specialized) / "is-a relationship
        - find common abstractionsand model those in our base class then having specialized classes derive those from the base class.
        

New things we learned today
    1. Enumerations
    2. instanceof Keyword
    3. How to work with a multifly Jave Program in  VS Code.
    4. Brief into to annotations mainly @Override
